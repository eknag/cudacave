## Summary
This site is just a simple blog that might contain various ramblings from time to time. This is primarily a learning tool that I'm using to better understand Webhosting.

## Infrastructure
This is a simple Jekyll site that I have set up on my server. It is tied to cudacave.com, which is set up via dynamic DNS and Google Domains.
I'm hosting everything using NGINX.

### The various guides I used to set up everything are
* Dynamic DNS [google tutorial](https://support.google.com/domains/answer/6147083?hl=en#zippy=%2Cset-up-a-client-program-on-your-gateway-host-or-server) and [actually good tutorial](https://jakeholmquist.medium.com/google-domains-dynamic-dns-with-google-domains-1dd0ea45c219)
* Setting up NGINX via [Nginx for beggineers](https://medium.com/swlh/create-your-own-linux-server-with-nginx-for-beginners-with-ip-public-40c6c004b0b4) and [Better DigitalOcean Article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-20-04).
* Jekyll Setup via [Jeckyll setup article](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/) and then swtiched to [digital ocean one](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-get-started-with-jekyll-on-an-ubuntu-vps)
* Jekyll-spaceship plugin added via [Jekyll-spaceship setup instructions](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-spaceship). This provides mathjax support.

## Important Commands
`edit_cudacave` and `deploy_cudacave` are scripts located in \bin that should be used to make changes to the website.

## Tips
Currently, I'm editing markdown files in VS code using the Grammarly extension. [Thank you](https://medium.com/@znck/grammarly-in-code-b62dd1a4c76e)
