# To Be Done

1. Extend the `deploy_cudacave` command so that it can deploy from any server over ssh
2. Fix sitemape so toplevel domain is prepended. currently shows "/jekyll/update/2021/11/02/raytune_exploration.html" but it should be "cudacave.com/jekyll/update/2021/11/02/raytune_exploration.html"
3. Explore Themes
4. Complete about page, etc so that default jekyll text is not remaining
5. Consider a nav bar
