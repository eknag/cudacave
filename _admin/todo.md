# To Be Done

1. Extend the `deploy_cudacave` command so that it can deploy from any server over ssh
2. Fix sitemape so top level domain is prepended. currently shows "/jekyll/update/2021/11/02/raytune_exploration.html" but it should be "cudacave.com/jekyll/update/2021/11/02/raytune_exploration.html"
3. Explore Themes
4. Complete about page, etc so that default jekyll text is not remaining
5. Consider a nav bar
6. Write article on setup
7. Write article on Eth mining and Overclock
8. Write article on server setup
9. Write article on loading training data directly onto gpu/profiling code
10. Write article on mixed precision training.
11. Enhance about section in a way that explains the goal of the site and links to my resume.
